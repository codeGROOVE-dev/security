# codeGROOVE Full Transparency Security Policy

## Philosophy

We encourage security research and aim to be fully transparent with the open-source community and customers alike on our security issues.

## In Scope Vulnerabilities

* We only accept vulnerabilities for code at HEAD within the following GitHub orgs: `codeGROOVE-dev` and `ready-to-run`
* We also accept vulnerabilities for any host in the domains: `*.codegroove.dev` and `*.ready-to-review.dev`

## Out of Scope Vulnerabilities

Anything our customers wouldn't care about; for example, spam attacks and self-owns using local clickjacking attacks or insecure SSL configurations.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Open a public issue here: https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/vulnerability-reports/issues

## Expectations

* Expect to hear back from us within 72 hours
* We do not offer bug bounties, but will donate $20 to any non-profit organization if:
  - You provide instructions for a non-theoretical example of the security flaw.
  - It's serious enough to warrant a code or configuration change
* We would absolutely love to collaborate on a blog article discussing the vulnerability, hosted on your site, our site, or both!
* As we are in a pre-release experimental phase, we are not currently issuing CVEs unless remote code execution is involved.

## Safe Harbor

We won't sue you for reporting security vulnerabilities; easy as that.
