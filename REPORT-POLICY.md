# Vulnerability Reporting Policy

We encourage security research and strive for full transparency with the community and our customers.

## Scope

* **In scope:** Code at HEAD within [codeGROOVE-dev](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/), hosts within `*.codegroove.dev` and `*.codegroove.app`
* **Out of scope:** Issues customers wouldn't care about (spam, local clickjacking, insecure SSL ciphers)

## Reporting

* Open a [public issue](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/security/issues)
* Alternatively, see our [security.txt](https://codegroove.dev/.well-known/security.txt)

## What to expect:

* Response within 24 hours, resolution within 72 hours
* A request to collaborate on a blog article
* $50 donation to a non-profit of your choice for serious vulnerabilities with reproduction steps

## Safe Harbor

We won't sue you for your security research. We consider it exempt from DMCA & CFAA prosecution and won't pursue legal action. Go crazy, but avoid customer harm.
