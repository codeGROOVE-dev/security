# Vulnerability Reporting Policy

## Philosophy

We encourage security research and aim for full transparency with the community and customers on security issues.

## Scope

**In scope:**
* Code at HEAD in GitHub orgs: `codeGROOVE-dev`
* Hosts in domains: `*.codegroove.dev` and `*.codegroove.app`

**Out of scope:** Issues customers wouldn't care about (spam attacks, local clickjacking, insecure SSL configs).

## Reporting

Open a public issue: [https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/vulnerability-reports/issues](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/security/issues)

Alternative reporting mechanisms are available: see https://codegroove.dev/.well-known/security.txt

**What to expect:**

* Response within 72 hours
* $50 donation to your chosen non-profit for serious vulnerabilities with non-theoretical reproduction steps
* We'd love to collaborate on a blog article about the vulnerability!

## Safe Harbor

We won't sue you for reporting vulnerabilities. Go crazy.
