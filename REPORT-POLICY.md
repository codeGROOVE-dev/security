# Vulnerability Reporting Policy

We encourage security research and strive for full transparency with the community and our customers regarding security issues.

## Scope

* **In scope:**: Code at HEAD found at https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/ and hosts within `*.codegroove.dev` and `*.codegroove.app`
* **Out of scope:** Issues customers wouldn't care about (spam attacks, local clickjacking, insecure SSL ciphers)

## Reporting

* Open a public issue: [https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/vulnerability-reports/issues](https://github.com/codeGROOVE-dev/security/issues)
* Alternative mechanisms: see https://codegroove.dev/.well-known/security.txt

## What to expect:

* Response within 72h
* $50 donation to your chosen non-profit for serious vulnerabilities with non-theoretical reproduction steps
* A request to collaborate on a blog article about the vulnerability

## Safe Harbor

We won't sue you for reporting vulnerabilities. Go crazy, but please avoid harming our customers.
